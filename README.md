Attendance System

A simple attendance system that allows the logging and registering of students' attendance using a unique ID.
This application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and stores student data and log records in Excel files.

Features:
- Student Registration: Register students with their full names and generate a unique student ID.
- Log Attendance: Log attendance by entering a student's ID. The log includes the student's name, time, and date.
- Excel Data Storage: All student and log data are stored in Users.xlsx and Log_Data.xlsx files.
- Clipboard Copy: Automatically copies the student ID to the clipboard after registration for easy pasting during attendance logging.

Included Files:
- `attendance_system.exe`: The standalone executable file for Windows.
- `source_code.py`: The Python source code for the application.
- `Users.xlsx`: Excel file that stores registered student data.
- `Log_Data.xlsx`: Excel file that logs attendance data.

How to Use:
1. Launch the App: Run the `attendance_system.exe` file to open the GUI.
2. Log Attendance: Enter the student ID and click "Log Time" to log attendance.
3. Register Student: Click "Register Student" to register a new student. The system generates a unique ID for each student.

Installation Instructions:
1. Download the project files and extract them.
2. Run the `attendance_system.exe` file to use the application.
3. Optionally, you can modify the source code (`source_code.py`) as needed.
